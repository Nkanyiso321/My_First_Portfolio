  <h2>About This Page</h2>
  <p>This is my very first custom webpage, built with simple HTML. It has headings, paragraphs, and even a clickable image.</p>

  <h3>Learning Journey</h3>
  <p>I am learning how to create webpages using HTML. Step by step, I’m building my first portfolio project.</p>

  <h2>What You’ll See</h2>
  <p>On this page, you’ll find headings of different levels, some descriptive text, and an image that you can click to go somewhere cool.</p>

  <h3>Why HTML Matters</h3>
  <p>HTML is the foundation of the web. Every webpage starts with HTML, and this is just the beginning of my journey as a developer.</p>
